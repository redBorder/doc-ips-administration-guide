== Event visualization

After the configuration, assignment and application of policies in the sensor is completed, the sensor starts analyzing the network traffic and sending the generated events to redborder Manager.

To visualize the sensor events you have to go to the analytical part of the platform, located on the left of the top panel of the web of redborder Manager. The IPS App is in this zone, from which it is possible to consult the information that the sensor is generating.
